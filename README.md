# SurfMapPics
Tandem project with my [SurfZones Project](https://github.com/Sayt123/SaytsSurfZones). I have gone through every single map I personally have, that loaded, and gathered screenshots of all maps, and every map bonus, in 3440x1440 / 21:9 JPEG. If you are a map's creator and have a better/preferred angle you would like me to use or suggest please feel free to email me. 

## How to use:
Clone this repo or grab the release, and host it somewhere you can point your timer/discord relay to pull from. 

In your surftimer.cfg located probably around /csgo/cfg/sourcemod, you can add your copy of this directory to the following two lines, to get the discord record image showing up in either color coded example in the image.

ðŸŸ© - **ck_discord_url_main
ðŸŸ¥ - ck_discord_url_thumb**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P0ttKJN.png">

Whether your timer supports it, bonus images can be enabled by setting **ck_discord_bonus_image "1"**

If your timer doesn't work like this or doesn't have any of these entries then I apologize but you're on your own on figuring it out. These images can be used for anything they aren't limited to just use for discord bots.

Progress:
