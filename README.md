# SurfMapPics
Tandem project with my [SurfZones Project](https://github.com/Sayt123/SaytsSurfZones). I'll be going through every single map I personally have at present and double checking zones, while also gather screenshots of all maps, and every map bonus, in the specifications below. This repository will be for people to point their discord record relays at if they want images and just so happen to like the way I'm presenting them for my personal setup.

## Image Specifications/Standards:
- All photos will be in 3440x1440 / 21:9 as jpegs.

## How to use:
Welp the repo is too big to point directly at I believe now, so, I recommend cloning and hosting on your own webhost or locally or whatever until I finish this, then I'll look into a public solution to host it. 

In your surftimer.cfg located probably around /csgo/cfg/sourcemod, you can add your copy of this directory to the following two lines, to get the discord record image showing up in either color coded example in the image.

ðŸŸ© - **ck_discord_url_main
ðŸŸ¥ - ck_discord_url_thumb**

Whether your timer supports it, I'll also be including bonus images which can be enabled by setting **ck_discord_bonus_image "1"**
