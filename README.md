# SurfMapPics
Tandem project with my [SurfZones Project](https://github.com/Sayt123/SaytsSurfZones). I have gone through every single map I personally have, that loaded, and gathered screenshots of all maps, and every map bonus, in 3440x1440 / 21:9 JPEG. If you are a map's creator and have a better/preferred angle you would like me to use or suggest please feel free to email me. 

## How to use:
Clone this repo or grab the release, and host it somewhere you can point your timer/discord relay to pull from. This, and my surfzones, are intended to be used subtractively. Remove images for maps you don't host, if you wish to debloat.

In your surftimer.cfg located probably around /csgo/cfg/sourcemod, you can add your copy of this directory to the following two lines, to get the discord record image showing up in either color coded example in the image.

ðŸŸ© - **ck_discord_url_main
ðŸŸ¥ - ck_discord_url_thumb**

<img src="https://i.imgur.com/P0ttKJN.png">

Whether your timer/plugin supports it, bonus images can be enabled by setting **ck_discord_bonus_image "1"**

If your timer doesn't work like this or doesn't have any of these entries then I apologize but you're on your own on figuring it out. These images can be used for anything they aren't limited to just use for discord bots.
