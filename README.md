## How to use?
If you want to use this set of images change the url below to do so, or plop them onto your server, do whatever. I recommend just using the default for now? I just wanted to fork this project to use as a base as it saves me some invaluable time for the image repository I'll be using for my setup. With no real final ETA I plan on going through the rest of the maps I actually have available to load from my zones file. All photos are just taken with standard camera/view settings with hud disabled, following qawery-just-sad's suggestions above. I try and focus on getting the starting platform or the first few ramps.

qawery-just-sad sums it up best.
"ehhh no idea it's just photos but if you would need a magical link there it is `https://raw.githubusercontent.com/qawery-just-sad/SurfMapPics/master/csgo/surf_XXX.jpg` obviously change the link to your needs"

I'm not quite sure if forking was the right course of action? I'm not super familiar with Git, I just was worried about the bloat to the main project, as I intend on making sure most map and name variants are covered, and my zones list has a few lower quality workshop maps that some might not even want to bother with hosting. Etc.
