# SurfMapPics
Collection for pictures of surf maps in csgo/css/momentum, with the goal being getting them all in 21:9 eventually.

## Contributions
1. Photo has to be at least in 3440x1440 resolution
2. Please keep the 21:9 ratio (this switch is the reason for the fork)
3. Format of photo has to be .jpg
4. profit?

## How to use?
You take this link here https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Sayt123/SurfMapPics/master/csgo/ and put it "ck_discord_url_main" here, for magic. 

I'm switching over all images eventually to 3440x1440 as I like the way it looks when records are reported in discord using that resolution. If you don't like the 21:9 aspect ratio on the bot then.. I don't know, resize these as you see fit?
