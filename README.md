# SurfMapPics
Tandem project with my [SurfZones Project](https://github.com/Sayt123/SaytsSurfZones). I have gone through every single map I personally have, that loaded, and gathered screenshots of all maps, and every map bonus, in 3440x1440 / 21:9 JPEG. If you are a map's creator and have a better/preferred angle you would like me to use or suggest please feel free to contact me. 

## How to use:
[SurfTimer-Official](https://github.com/surftimer/Surftimer-Official) now supports [Sarrus1's SurfTimer-Discord plugin](https://github.com/Sarrus1/SurfTimer-discord). Follow the instructions on Sarrus's plugin page and the images for your records will be pulled from this repo automatically.


If you would like to make tweaks, debloat, or generally just self-host the images then clone this repo, and host the images somewhere you can point your timer/discord relay to pull from.

Example:
**sm_surftimer_discord_main_url_root "https://cooltotallynotfakesurf.com/images"**

"But what if I want them in [a different resolution?](https://github.com/search?q=bulk+image+resize)"

"Well what if I want to [add a watermark?](https://github.com/search?q=bulk+image+watermark)"

"This map/bonus doesn't have a picture" Well in that case please let me know! I'd like to cover all common name variations in the near future for maps that have any.
